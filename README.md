# chat-app
this chat-application is based on javascript libraries such as socket.io , express and npm manager . You can do realtime chatting with your friends , family and friends without any interruption .For more details and process of building it refer to the Readme.md file of the project


so we will make up the chatting app by following some simple steps:
#1 install the npm and then create an app in react using create react-app *file.js .
#2 install dependencies : a) npm install express (for express installation) b) npm install socket.io (for socket.io installation)
then look into package.json for dev dependensies(if installed in dev mode)
#3 start by creating a simple html page such as index.html for interface where your messages and receiving messages shows up . Then add some styling by using style.css
dir route : 
|node_modules
|index.html
|index.js
|package.lock.json
|package.json
(note that index.html and index.js are both in root dir and style and script of client side is included in index.html page using <style> tag and <script> tag)
#4 create an index.js for server side code and refer index.js code as given in git in this project code section
#5 now include <script> in index.html for client side code where you receive messages . Refer index.html code given in code section
#6 once done with  all programming now use node index.js in terminal to get your chat-app as react app .

# NOTE: take help of node documentation and socket.io documentation for better understanding .

THANKYOU...
